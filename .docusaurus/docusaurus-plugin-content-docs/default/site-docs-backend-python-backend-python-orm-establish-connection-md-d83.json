  "description": "The start of any SQLAlchemy application is an object called the  Engine. This object acts as a central source of connections to a particular database, providing both a factory as well as a holding space called a  connection pool  for these database connections. The engine is typically a global object created just once for a particular database server, and is configured using a URL string which will describe how it should connect to the database host or backend.",
